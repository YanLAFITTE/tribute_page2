            <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Mestre Bimba's life:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>1899</strong> - Mestre Bimba (Manuel dos Reis Machado) was born in Salvador, Brasil. </li>

                <li><strong>1937</strong> - The Academy of Mestre Bimba was the first to receive official authorization to teach Capoeira, following a public demonstration before the then president Getúlio Vargas, who revoked the Sampaio Ferraz law, thus legally authorizing capoeira.

                <li><strong>1968</strong> - He appears in "Dança de guerra" the film of his disciple Jair Moura.</li>
                <li><strong>1973</strong> - Dissatisfied with the promises and the lack of support from the local authorities in Bahia, he left for Goiânia with his family at the invitation of a former disciple, Oswaldo de Souza.</li>
                <li><strong>1974</strong> - Mestre Bimba dies at the age of 75. </li>
                <li><strong>1979</strong> - The mortuary remains of Bimba were transferred to Bahia, at the initiative of his disciples, and since 1994 have rested in the ossuary of Ordem Terceira do Carmo.</li>
                <li><strong>1979</strong> - The Federal University of Bahia awarded the honorary title of doctor honoris causa to Manoel dos Reis Machado, illiterate black, who died twenty-two years earlier.</li>
            </ul>

                <p>"It was in the senzalas of Reconcavo that Capoeira was born."
                <br>"The blacks, yes, were from Angola, but Capoeira is from Cachoeira, Santo Amaro and the island of Maré."</p>
